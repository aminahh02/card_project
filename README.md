## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt more about the <div> element.
I learnt about overflow.

some codes I found out about along the way:
```css
.round {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
```css
.container {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to work more on images and <div>s. I had little problems with them regarding size and height.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/5-simple-ways-to-center-a-div-horizontally-and-vertically-in-css-23bbaa5f9f52) - This helped me centralize my content, was somehow easier for me than flex.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE) - This is an amazing video, really helped me understand CSS grid better for when I wanted to adjust my footer.
